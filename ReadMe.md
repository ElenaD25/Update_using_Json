##Update a table using Json
I faced a challenge while developing an app with 2 other colleagues. We had to update a table, but we didn't know exactly which fields the user will update. After a short discussion we concluded that is better to send a Json to the database and make the update based on the fields provided inside it.

Because we had a few tables that required this operation, i thought about doing a dynamic stored procedure (i used dynamic sql) where we can provide the following info: - schema name - table name - condition (to avoid disaster :) ) - json

##How it was made
first i started to create the stored procedure by giving it a name and declaring the params
i declared the variables that will be used in the cursor and also the variable that will contain the final statement
i did some checks on schema name, table name and condition
i started composing the cursor that goes through the json and, step by step, i added to the @sql variable the columns and the values needed for the update
i closed and deallocated the cursor and i added the condition to the @sql variable
i executed the @sql variable which contained the update statement
Execution syntax
exec crc.Update_using_Json @schema_name = 'your schema name (in my case 'crc'), @table_name = 'your table name', @condition = 'your condition (for example: 'id = 2')', @json = '{"table_column_name":"value","table_column_name":"value", "table_column_name":"value"}'

!!Do not forget that the Json must contain the names of the columns in the table!!
!!Be careful if you create the sp in another schema because its name must be declared in the @schema parameter and also in front sp name (when you create and execute it)
